## Overview
The VAL3000 is the easiest, fastest, cheapest, safest, and most wireless way to spin a stepper motor.

You can precisely control a motor's distance, speed, current, and stall characteristics within minutes of receiving it. No programming experience is required.

If you want to program it yourself, all code is included.

The VAL3000 contains the following components in a very small package:

- Espressif ESP32-C3
- Trinamic TMC2209 motor driver with StallGuard and StealthChop
- Synchronous DC/DC converter
- Three button inputs

#### Setup only takes 3 minutes and 3 steps

1. Connect any bipolar (4-wire) stepper motor
2. Connect a 12-24V 2A+ power supply (2.1mm x 5.5mm barrel connector)
3. Open a browser and connect via WiFi


And that's it!

If you love to program, that's great! We've made it extremely simple to do so. Simply download the source code on Github and plug in a USB cord to quickly flash your new firmware.



## WiFi Control

The VAL3000 is already loaded with firmware to get you going right away.
Simply connect to it via WiFi and get the motor going right away.


## Detailed Features
### Trinamic TMC2209
The Trinamic TMC2209 is one of the best stepper motor drivers on the market. It is very feature-rich while being affordable.


#### Easily program from the ESP32 via USB
Includes the extremely popular and useful StallGuard feature. Easily set it to stop whenever the force on your motor exceeds a certain force. This makes it very safe to use for all types of projects.


#### Customizable Stepper Motor Connector
You can connect a motor in three ways. The board has a 4-pin JST XH plug. Additionally, it has the 4 pins exposed and comes with a 4-pin screw terminal, like below. You can solder your motor wires directly to the board or solder this screw terminal.

#### USB-C Port
Easily flash the firmware using the USB-C port


#### Three Buttons
Sometimes it's nice to press a button to open or close your device. That's why we've included three buttons to do just that. The MorningRope uses the top two buttons to open/close and the bottom button to reset the WiFi.


#### Stepper Motor
Connect any 4-Wire Bipolar stepper motor


#### On-Board Voltage Regulator

The 1A Synchronous DC/DC converter provides ultra-high efficient voltage regulation in a compact design.


#### ESP32-C3
This ESP32-C3 sits at the heart of the board. Its low-cost to high-performance ratio is unlike any other. It provides stepper motor control as well as maintains the wireless connection for WiFi and MQTT access.
